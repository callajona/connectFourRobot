# Connect Four Robot
Summer Internship Project - Making a Robot Play Connect Four


## Overview
- Using Raspberry Pi 5
- Camera used to capture the state of a game - openCV used to analyse state of game
- Algorithm used to determine the next best move
- Robot used to enact the move

# How the Algorithm Works
Choosing the Best path in a decision tree

# Next steps
- Camera capture in code
- Solving algorithm implementation
- Top-level code design
